# Spring Cloud Contracts

### Introduction
Checking out this project will give you a very simple microservice architecture on your local environment.

All modules will inherit from spring-boot-starter-parent:1.4.3.RELEASE

Quick overview of the modules:

- **eureka-server** will act as a service discovery server. Microservices can register with the eureka-server to look up other microservice and/or to be discoverable by other microservices. <br>
-*application.yml* contains configuration regarding the port of the application. It also disables registration and registry fetching since the server itself does not need to discover other services, or be discoverable in this example.<br>
-*pom.xml* contains the only extra dependency we need to start the eureka server: `spring-cloud-starter-eureka-server`<br>
-*EurekaServerApplication* is the main class, all that is needed to start the Eureka Server including a complete working fronted is the annotation: `@EnableEurekaServer`
- **numbers-service** is the microservice in this example. <br>
-*application.yml* contains configuration value 0 for the port of the appliction. This means a random port will be assigned making it possible to run several instances of the microservice on your machine. It also contains some information regarding the EurekaServer<br>
-*pom.xml* contains two extra dependencies we need to enable RestControllers and the Discovery Client: `spring-boot-starter-web` and `spring-cloud-starter-eureka`<br>
-*NumbersServiceApplication* is the main class, by adding the `@EnableDiscoveryClient` annotation the service will register itself with the Eureka discovery server using the name defined in *bootstrap.yml*
- **frontend** is the frontend of our application. It uses thymeleaf to serve a webinterface. It uses ribbon to implement clientside loadbalancing to the microservices listed by the Eureka Server.<br>
-*application.yml* contains configuration value 8080 for the port of the application. It also has some configuration for eureka, this application will not register itself. It will not be discoverable, but will be able to discover other service, for instance the numbers-service.<br>
-*pom.xml* contains some extra dependencies for the frontend. Regarding the microservice it's important to notice `spring-cloud-starter-eureka` and `spring-cloud-starter-ribbon`.<br>
-*FrontendApplication* is the main class, notice our RestTemplate is `@LoadBalanced` which implements clientside loadbalancing to the services listed by the Eureka Server.

You should have an understanding of this microservice architecture now. If you don't please do the following workshop by JDriven: [https://bitbucket.org/jdriven/spring-cloud-workshop]()
The modules in this project are a simplified version of the spring cloud workshop.

### About Cloud Contracts
Cloud Contracts is an implementation for Spring of Consumer Driven Testing. The mechanism provides a way for the consumer of an API to define tests. The idea behind the mechanism is that the consumer of an API creates a test suite for the subset of endpoints, and the subset of data the api is actually using. These tests should also be available at the api producer side and be part of the build process. When a producer changes the API the build should fail when consumer test fail, preventing failure in clients. Based on the consumer contract the consumer can generate stubs to be used in it's own unit tests. Spring has added the Spring Cloud Contracs libraries to implement Consumer Driven Testing, hinting at it's usefulness for Microservice architectures. Consumer Driven Testing can however, be implemented for any API.

## Task 0: 
Start all the applications using the main function in the different Application files in the 3 modules. Everything should start normally. You can start several instances of the numbers-service module.<br>
Navigating to http://127.0.0.1:8761 will open the eureka dashboard, listing one (or more) numbers-service instances.<br>
Navigating to http://127.0.0.1:8080 will open the frontend application where you can request prime numbers.<br>
Stop all the instances.

## Task 1: Adding support for cloud contracts to the producers code

### Introduction
Spring Cloud Contracts uses groovy files to create the consumer test suite. The groovy definition is used by the library `spring-cloud-starter-contract-verifier` and the `spring-cloud-contract-maven-plugin` which are intended for the producer side of the api. This plugin uses a base test class and the groovy files to generate a set of unit tests for the producer which validates the contracts. The contracts themselves are definitions of a request with matching response. In the first task the api producer will be modified to support CloudContracts. To verify everything is working a groovy testcase will be added for the existing endpoint, testing the happy flow. This workshop will focus on happy flows, but Cloud Contracts can also be used to define expected responses when the request is not valid.

**Task 1.1** Add the `spring-cloud-starter-contract-verifier` dependency to the numbers-service module's pom file under TODO 1.1.<br>
*(If necesary, refresh your maven dependencies!)*
		
	<dependency>
		<groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
		<artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-contract-verifier</artifactId>
		<scope>test</scope>
	</dependency>
	
**Task 1.2** Add the `spring-cloud-contract-maven-plugin` build plugin to the numbers-service module's pom file under TODO 1.2.<br>
*(If necesary, refresh your maven dependencies!)*

	<build>
		<plugins>
			<plugin>
				<groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
				<artifactId>spring-cloud-contract-maven-plugin</artifactId>
				<version>1.0.3.RELEASE</version>
				<extensions>true</extensions>
				<configuration>
					<baseClassForTests>nl.johannisk.cloud.contract.BaseTest</baseClassForTests>
				</configuration>
			</plugin>
		</plugins>
	</build>	
> This build plugin can generate unit tests based on contracts. Note the baseClassForTests property, we need to supply a base class for generated tests

**Task 1.3** Create a new test class in the numbers-service module in the package `nl.johannisk.cloud.contract` named `BaseTest`. You might need to create the test folder first, make sure you create the BaseTest in the correct test package.
> The full path from the projecet root should be numbers-service -> src -> test -> java
	
	package nl.johannisk.cloud.contract;
	
	import com.jayway.restassured.module.mockmvc.RestAssuredMockMvc;
	import nl.johannisk.cloud.numbersservice.NumbersServiceApplication;
	import org.junit.Before;
	import org.junit.runner.RunWith;
	import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
	import org.springframework.boot.test.context.SpringBootTest;
	import org.springframework.test.context.junit4.SpringRunner;
	import org.springframework.web.context.WebApplicationContext;
	
	@RunWith(SpringRunner.class)
	@SpringBootTest(classes = NumbersServiceApplication.class, webEnvironment = 	SpringBootTest.WebEnvironment.RANDOM_PORT)
	public abstract class BaseTest {
	
	    @Autowired
	    private WebApplicationContext appContext;
	
	    @Before
	    public void setup() {
	        RestAssuredMockMvc.webAppContextSetup(appContext);
	    }
	}
> This BaseTest will be extended by the generated tests. In this workshop the BaseTest will create a full ApplicationContext, but it is possible to create specific Controller tests.

**Task 1.4** Per default the build task looks for contracts in a test resource folder named `contracts`. Create this folder.
> The full path from the projecet root should be numbers-service -> src -> test -> resources -> contracts

**Task 1.5** Create a groovy contract in the numbers-service module for the prime numbers call in the test resources contracts folder named `returnPrimesFrom1to10.groovy`

	package contracts;
	
	org.springframework.cloud.contract.spec.Contract.make {
		request {
			method 'POST'
			url '/primenumbers'
			body([
				from:1,
				to:10
				])
			headers {
				header('Content-Type', 'application/json;charset=UTF-8')
			}
		}
		response {
			status 200
			body([
				primeNumbers: [2,3,5,7],
				instanceId: value(consumer('numbers-service-005887b1ff2a0c4cf0b94414d6e74a3a'),
                      producer(regex('numbers-service-[a-fA-F0-9]{32}')))
				])
			headers {
				header('Content-Type': 'application/json;charset=UTF-8')
			}
		}
	}
> The groovy file contains a request object and a response object. The contract it defines can be translated to:
> When I POST to /primenumbers, with a body containing a from = 1  and a to = 10 key/value pair, I expect a status 200 with a body containing the primaNumbers in the given range an the instance id of the service responding.
> Note the instanceId value. This value is declared for the consumer as a static value, and for the producer as a regular expression. The purpose of this is to illustrate the value of fields can be different for the producer generated tests, and the client generated stubs.

**Task 1.6** run `mvn clean install` in the numbers-service module

###Summary

The microservice now suppports cloud contracts. The `mvn clean install` command should have executed correctly giving a few errors on the Discovery Client. Since we don't have a eureka instance running the test complains about not being able te register itself. This can be solved with more specific and finegrained BaseTest(s) (yes, you can have more), but this is not in scope in this workshop.

Note the following line in the build log:
`[INFO] Installing /****/CloudContractsWorkshop/numbers-service/target/numbers-service-1.0-SNAPSHOT-stubs.jar to /****/.m2/repository/nl/johannisk/numbers-service/1.0-SNAPSHOT/numbers-service-1.0-SNAPSHOT-stubs.jar`
	
With the new dependency and build plugin, `mvn clean install` now generates a stubs jar, and installs it in the local maven repository.

## Task 2: Adding support for cloud contracts to the consumers code

### Introduction
The tests created in the previous tasks can also be used by the consumer in the form of stubs. This has several advantages during development. You can develop the client using the stubs which means your independent from the producer, and the stubs can also be used to test your client without setting up a full integration environment allowing you to fail fast.
Cloud Contracts uses two libraries to accomplish this `spring-cloud-contract-wiremock` is used to mock http connections and `spring-cloud-starter-contract-stub-runner` is used to run the stubs generated by the consumer tests. Stubrunner can also mock your cloud tooling like the service discovery service in this workshop, allowing for completely isolated tests of a service. In this task a test wil be added to test the existing API call. The test will use the stubs and an autoconfigured stubrunner to validate the client.

**Task 2.1** Add the `spring-cloud-contract-wiremock` and `spring-cloud-starter-contract-stub-runner` dependencies to the frontend module's pom file under TODO 2.1. <br>
*(If necesary, refresh your maven dependencies!)*

	<dependency>
		<groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
		<artifactId>spring-cloud-contract-wiremock</artifactId>
		<scope>test</scope>
	</dependency>
	<dependency>
		<groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
		<artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-contract-stub-runner</artifactId>
		<scope>test</scope>
	</dependency>

**Task 2.2** Add configuration for stubrunner to the frontend module's application.yml under TODO 2.2. 

	stubrunner:
	  ids: nl.johannisk:numbers-service:+:stubs:0
	  work-offline: true

> The "ids" property will download the stubs for the repository identifier en configure the port which it is run on. It's format is:<br> `<groupId>:<artifactId>:<version ... + means latest>:<submodule>:<port ... 0 means random>`<br>
> The "work-offline" property will tell stubrunner to download the artifact from your local .m2 repository.

**Task 2.3** Create a new test class in the frontend module in the package `nl.johannisk.cloud.frontend.client` named `NumberServiceClientTest`. You might need to create the test folder first, make sure you create the NumberServiceClientTest in the correct test package.
> The full path from the projecet root should be frontend -> src -> test -> java

	package nl.johannisk.cloud.frontend.client;
	
	import org.junit.Before;
	import org.junit.Test;
	import org.junit.runner.RunWith;
	import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
	import org.springframework.boot.test.context.SpringBootTest;
	import org.springframework.cloud.contract.stubrunner.spring.AutoConfigureStubRunner;
	import org.springframework.test.context.junit4.SpringRunner;
	import org.springframework.web.client.RestTemplate;
	
	import java.util.ArrayList;
	import java.util.List;
	
	import static org.junit.Assert.*;
	
	@RunWith(SpringRunner.class)
	@SpringBootTest(webEnvironment= SpringBootTest.WebEnvironment.NONE)
	@AutoConfigureStubRunner
	public class NumberServiceClientTest {
	
	    @Autowired
	    private RestTemplate restTemplate;
	    private NumberServiceClient client;
	
	    @Before
	    public void setUp() {
	        client = new NumberServiceClient(restTemplate);
	    }
	
	    @Test
	    public void getPrimeNumbersFrom1till10() {
	        PrimeNumbersResponse response = client.calculatePrimeNumbers(new PrimeNumbersRequest(1,10));
	
	        List<Integer> primes = new ArrayList<>();
	        primes.add(2);
	        primes.add(3);
	        primes.add(5);
	        primes.add(7);
	
	        assertTrue(response.getPrimeNumbers().equals(primes));
	    }
	
	    // TODO 3.3
	}

> Note the annotation `@AutoConfigureStubRunner`. This annotation will stub the discovery server as well as the stubs configured in the application.yml

**Task 2.4** Run the unit test, is should succeed. 

###Summary

The frontend now also suppports cloud contracts. The test uses known parameters which are also configured in the contract at the producers side. We can now test, through the cloud contract, that the producer and the consumer have agreed on the service api, and are both conforming to it.

A few lines in the log of the test might be interesting:

These lines show the stubs are downloaded and instantiated on port 64914

## Task 3: Consuming a new service endpoint using cloud contracts
###Introduction
In task 1 support for cloud contracts was added to the producers code. By running `mvn clean install` the stubs jar was created and uploaded to the local mvn repository. In task 2 support for cloud contracts was added to the consumers code, which also used the local repository to download the stubs jar from.
We will be adding a new contract in this task, directly in the producers code. Normally this new contract would be added in a local checkout of the producers code. To have the contract implemented by the producer the contract would be submitted to the producer via a merge request. This is out of scope for the workshop, but it's important to remember this, since we will be coming back to this point.
The contract will be added in the form of a groovy contract much like the contract which is already in place. It will define the proposed request form, as well as the expected response. Before going to the producers code in Task 4, we'll create a full implementation of the client purely based on the stubs generated by the contract definition.

**Task 3.1** Add a new contract next to the `returnPrimesFrom1to10.groovy` file named `returnFibonacciUntil10.groovy`

	package contracts;

	org.springframework.cloud.contract.spec.Contract.make {
   		request {
   			method 'POST'
			url '/fibonaccinumbers'
			body(
				[until:10]
			)
			headers {
				header('Content-Type', 'application/json;charset=UTF-8')
			}
		}
		response {
			status 200
			body(
				[
					fibonacciNumbers: [0,1,1,2,3,5,8],
					instanceId: value(consumer('numbers-service-005887b1ff2a0c4cf0b94414d6e74a3a'),
                      producer(regex('numbers-service-[a-fA-F0-9]{32}')))
				]
			)
			headers {
				header('Content-Type': 'application/json;charset=UTF-8')
			}
		}
	}

**Task 3.2** Build the numbers-service without tests using `mvn clean install -DskipTests`
> Since there is no implementation in the producers code the generated tests would fail. As a consumer we are only interested in the generated stubs. That's why the parameter -DskipTests is added.

**Task 3.3** Go back to the frontend application. Find the NumberServiceClientTest file and add a test case for the Fibonacci service under TODO 3.3 (replace or add the TODO 5.3, you'll need it later)

	//TODO 5.3
	@Test
	public void getFibonacciNumbersUntill10() {
        FibonacciNumbersResponse response = client.calculateFibonacciNumbers(new FibonacciNumbersRequest(10));

        List<Integer> fibonacci = new ArrayList<>();
        fibonacci.add(0);
        fibonacci.add(1);
        fibonacci.add(1);
        fibonacci.add(2);
        fibonacci.add(3);
        fibonacci.add(5);
        fibonacci.add(8);

        assertTrue(response.getFibonacciNumbers().equals(fibonacci));
    }
> Note that the unit test almost exactly matches the contract. It's important to remember that the stubs are generated based on the contract, so the unit test can't test other input values.
    
This test should be full of compiler errors, so let's fix those.

**Task 3.4** Create a FibonacciNumbersRequest object in the frontend application

	package nl.johannisk.cloud.frontend.client;
	
	public class FibonacciNumbersRequest {

		//TODO 5.2
		private final Integer untill;
		
		public FibonacciNumbersRequest(Integer untill) {
			this.untill = untill;
		}

		public Integer getUntil() {
			return untill;
		}
	}
	
> Note that this is based on the request specified in our newly created fibonacci contract.

**Task 3.5** Create a FibonacciNumbersResponse object in the frontend application

    package nl.johannisk.cloud.frontend.client;

    import com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonCreator;
    import com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonProperty;

    import java.util.List;

    public class FibonacciNumbersResponse {

        private final List<Integer> fibonacciNumbers;
        private final String instanceId;

        @JsonCreator
        public FibonacciNumbersResponse(@JsonProperty("fibonacciNumbers") List<Integer> fibonacciNumbers, @JsonProperty("instanceId") String instanceId) {
            this.fibonacciNumbers = fibonacciNumbers;
            this.instanceId = instanceId;
        }

        public List<Integer> getFibonacciNumbers() {
            return fibonacciNumbers;
        }

        public String getInstanceId() {
            return instanceId;
        }
    }

> Note (again) that this is based on the response specified in our newly created fibonacci contract.

**Task 3.6** Create the `calculateFibonacciNumbers` method in the NumbersServiceClient under TODO 3.6 in the fronted module.

	public FibonacciNumbersResponse calculateFibonacciNumbers(FibonacciNumbersRequest fibonacciNumbersRequest) {
        return restTemplate.postForObject("http://numbers-service/fibonaccinumbers",
                fibonacciNumbersRequest,
                FibonacciNumbersResponse.class);
    }
 > Note (for the last time) that the endpoint to post to matches the endpoint defined in the contract 
 > 
 > Please check the modified files to fix any import problems. They shouldn't occur if you followed this workshop, but might if you mixed up or changed packaging.
 
**Task 3.7** Run the newly created test in NumberServiceClientTest either from the IDE or with a `mvn clean install` in the frontend module.

### Summary
The frontend now has a new client to retrieve Fibonacci numbers. Against the generated stubs the unit tests are green. If the producer is done with the implementation of the contract our frontend should be able to communicated with the producer in a fully working production environment. When the producer has finished implementation there is an extra step to fail fast. In the application.yml we've configured stubrunner to work offline. This means it will retrieve the stubs from our local .m2 repository. The configuration can be changed to retrieve the stubs from the artifactory, which would mean we can test our branch against the generated stubs from the producers implementation. In the next task it will become clear why this step is very useful.

## Task 4: Developing a new service endpoint using cloud contracs
### Introduction
Now that the client is working the producer needs to implement the service. We've build the numbers-service code on our consumer side with `mvn clean install -DskipTests`. The reason for this, is that we wanted the stubs to be generated by the build process. Cloud contracts also generated unit-tests based on the contract on the producer side. Normally the consumer would submit a new contract through a pull request. Let's assume you are now the implementor of the producer, and you've just checked out the pull request.

**Task 4.1** Start the eureka-server module
> This step is not needed for the rest of this task, but because we launch the entire ApplicationContext in our BaseTest there'll be a lot of errors when eureka is not running. This is not a real issue, but will clutter the logs.

**Task 4.2** Run `mvn clean install` in the numbers-service module.
> Note that the build fails on the ContractVerifierTest

> The endpoint for Fibonacci is not found. 

**Task 4.3** As the producer we want the new endpoint to conform to the first one. Change the contract. Rename the contract file from `returnFibonacciUntil10` to `returnFibonacciFrom1to10` and replace it's contents.

    package contracts;
    
    org.springframework.cloud.contract.spec.Contract.make {
        request {
            method 'POST'
            url '/fibonaccinumbers'
            body(
                    [from:1,
                     to:10]
            )
            headers {
                header('Content-Type', 'application/json;charset=UTF-8')
            }
        }
        response {
            status 200
            body(
                    [
                            fibonacciNumbers: [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8],
                            instanceId  : value(consumer('numbers-service-005887b1ff2a0c4cf0b94414d6e74a3a'),
                                    producer(regex('numbers-service-[a-fA-F0-9]{32}')))
                    ]
            )
            headers {
                header('Content-Type': 'application/json;charset=UTF-8')
            }
        }
    }
> Note that there is a small change in the contract. The request body as specified by the consumer would be `untill: 10`. To conform to the other endpoint we changed this to from:1, to:10. 
    
**Task 4.4** Create a class FibonacciNumbersService in the numbers-service module in the service package.

    package nl.johannisk.cloud.numbersservice.service;

    import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;

    import java.util.ArrayList;
    import java.util.Arrays;
    import java.util.List;
    import java.util.stream.Collectors;

    @Service
    public class FibonacciNumbersService {

        public List<Integer> calculateFibonacciNumbers(int from, int to) {
            List<Integer> fibonacci = new ArrayList<>(Arrays.asList(0));
            int nextFibonacci = 1;
            while (nextFibonacci <= to) {
                fibonacci.add(nextFibonacci);
                nextFibonacci = fibonacci.get(fibonacci.size() - 1) + fibonacci.get(fibonacci.size() - 2);
            }
            return fibonacci.stream().filter(number -> number >= from).collect(Collectors.toList());
        }
    }
> This calculation will match the contract. Normally there would be more unit test written by the producer to guarantee the "business logic" is working correctly. This is not in scope of the workshop, but be aware the the implementation for the contract could have been much simpler: `return Arrays.asList(new Integer[]{1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8});`

**Task 4.8** Run `mvn clean install` in the numbers-service module. It should compile without errors.

## Task 5: Verifying our client using cloud contracs
### Introduction
The producer has notified the consumer that the service is implemented and will be available soon, they have however changed the contract. In the following steps we're still talking to our local m2 repository. Normally, at this point you would change the properties to work online and provide a url to the maven repository. This way you would verify against the stubs generated by the producer based on the code they will deploy to production, which passed the contracts available to this producer.

**Task 5.1** Open the frontend module and navigate to the NumbersServiceClientTest. Execute the tests. The `getFibonacciNumbersUntill10` should fail.

	}

> Stubrunner hints at endpoints when there's no exact match. The call our consumer executes doesn't match since the producer has changed the contract, but Stubrunner finds a very close match. In the next tasks we'll conform to the new contract.

**Task 5.2** Replace the complete implementation of the FibonacciNumbersRequest in the frontend module under TODO 5.2.

	private final Integer from;
    private final Integer to;

    public FibonacciNumbersRequest(Integer from, Integer to) {
        this.from = from;
        this.to = to;
    }

    public Integer getFrom() {
        return from;
    }

    public Integer getTo() {
        return to;
    }
> The old FibonacciNumbersRequest didn't match the contract anymore. The changes made to this Request implementation reflect the changes the producer made to the contract, changing untill into from and to.

**Task 5.3** Replace the complete test funcion getFibonacciNumbersUntill10 with the new test in the frontend module's test class under TODO 5.3.

    @Test
    public void getFibonacciNumbersFrom1till10() {
    
        FibonacciNumbersResponse response = client.calculateFibonacciNumbers(new FibonacciNumbersRequest(1,10));
    
        List<Integer> fibonacci = new ArrayList<>();
        fibonacci.add(1);
        fibonacci.add(1);
        fibonacci.add(2);
        fibonacci.add(3);
        fibonacci.add(5);
        fibonacci.add(8);
    
        assertTrue(response.getFibonacciNumbers().equals(fibonacci));
    }
> Here we changed the name of the Test (which is not needed, but defines the test better), and used our new Request implementation to match the contract again. Note that the expected list also changed.

**Task 5.4** Run `mvn clean install` in the frontend module. It should compile without errors.

##Conclusion
The frontend should now be able to connect to the new numbers-service endpoint. This is the end of this workshop, but you can implement the client further to actually use the service in it's frontend. This is task 6.<br>
Cloud Contracts provide a very useful mechanism to generate extra tests and stubs to verify the integration between services. In my opinion one of the greatest features is that the producer and the consumer are talking to the same contract and are both obligated to maintain the contract when making changes to the client or the producer. The consumer needs the changes to generate the correct stubs, while the producer needs the changes because otherwise the generated tests will fail. A possible pittfall is that the contract only needs to be changed when either side wants to make breaking changes or add functionality. When functionality or data is no longer used by a client this wont be breaking change to the stubs. This might clutter the contracts making a producer implement a contract with fields which are no longer used.
Cloud Contracts is in no way a replacement of good team to team communications or the projects own unit tests.

The final task:
**Task 6** Create a nice frontend for the fibonacci service so we can verify manually that it works!
